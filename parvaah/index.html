                    named Parvaah, works each year with a purpose of providing to the 
                    underprivileged and oppressed. This time around, Parvaah is on a 
                    mission to establish a “Zero Waste Community,” wherein constant efforts 
                    are being made for reducing, reusing and recycling the waste 
                    generated and contributing back to the society.</p>

                <h1>SCHOOL AWARENESS CAMPAIGN</h1>
                <p>
                    It is said ‘The students of today are the future of tomorrow’. 
                    Realising this, Parvaah plans on visiting schools in Mumbai and 
                    teach the students the basic principles of a zero waste community. 
                    It’s an attempt to educate the students as well as the staff of 
                    the school about the need to go zero waste. Along with this, 
                    we also aim at transforming the schools into a zero waste locality. 
                    Instilling a sense of responsibility in the students towards managing 
                    their waste will go a long way in realising our goal of a cleaner Mumbai.

                <h1>PLASTIC & E-COLLECTION DRIVE</h1>
                <p>
                    Keeping in mind the perils caused by plastic and e-waste, 
                    Parvaah has decided to conduct a collection drive for these 
                    hazardous items. The plastic and e-waste which is collected will 
                    then be sent for recycling thus ensuring there is no harm caused 
                    towards the environment. E-waste contains heavy metals like 
                    cadmium, lead, copper, and chromium that can contaminate the environment 
                    while plastic, on the other hand, is made from toxic compounds known 
                    to cause illness, and because it is meant for durability, it is not 
                    biodegradable. Constituting a major chunk of our waste, a proper and 
                    efficient disposal of these items is the need of the hour.

                <h1>SIGNAL SHALA</h1>
                <p>
                    Signal Shala is an innovative concept initialized by Samarth Bharat Vyaspith 
                    along with Thane Municipal Corporation, to provide education to underprivileged 
                    children living on signals in Thane. Situated in a small container below a 
                    bridge, the main aim of Signal Shala is to make these kids capable of adjusting 
                    themselves with the mainstream world. We at Parvaah plan on spreading awareness 
                    about Zero Waste with the help of these kids and also teach them simple ways 
                    to treat their waste. As signals witness a frequent number of vehicles, we aim 
                    to use this medium to make the people aware of the basic habits they can 
                    follow to effectively manage their waste. We at Parvaah believe that only when 
                    it is a collective effort of all its citizens can a city truly make great progress 
                    in achieving a goal.

                <p>
                    On the occasion of Christmas, Parvaah plans on visiting an 
                    orphanage and celebrate with the kids. To further the joy, 
                    we would also be distributing toys, goodies, and sweets among 
                    the kids. This would be followed by playing games with the children, 
                    interacting with them and ensuring that everyone has a 
                    smile on his or her face.
