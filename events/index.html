                                Battle of the Bands is a competition where amateur/semi-pro bands from all over the country participate in a face-off to see which band has been blessed by the gods of rock. With distortion-heavy guitar riffs, groovy bass lines, and blast beats enticing the audience to a moshable frenzy, this is one event that any metalhead or rock fanatic wouldn’t want to miss out on.
                                With a massive crowd, amazing incentives, and energetic performances, Symphony has always been a platform that has believed in boosting various artists to the well-deserving fame!
