                        <p>The contained spirit of Symphony is slowly unsealing and is on the verge of breaking into the endless colours of the cosmos. That being said, few questions still remain; if your brain controls your body, what is it that controls your brain? What would happen if that thing in your head knew no bounds? The human mind is littered with fanciful thoughts and images. More often than not, these wonderland-esque fancies are lost to the unforgiving monotony of life. But, what if we put aside their absurdity and reconsider them with sincerity? What if the sheep that you counted as you fell into a sweet slumber, appear around your bed in the morning? What if felines could fly? What if Lucy really did live in the sky with diamonds? Symphony stands at a crossroads, with one end pointing towards the undecipherable and the other at the mediocre everyday life full of prosaicness, as the two bleed into each other. At Symphony, we believe firmly in answering the ‘what if’s that flow through the depths of an inquisitive mind. If the imagery of such an obscure thing bemuses you as well as gives you goosebumps then stick around; because these surreal fantasies soon take form, only at Symphony 2019: A Warped Reality!</p>
